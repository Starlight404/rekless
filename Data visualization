#R data visuliazation

#data visuliazation is an efficient technique for gaining 
#insight about data through a visual medium. with the help 
#of visualization techniques, a human can easily obtain information about 
# hidden patterns in data that might be neglectated



# R pie charts
#pie chart is a representation of values in the form of slices
#of a circle with different colors 
#the pie chart are created with help of pie ()
#which takes positive numbers as vector inputs


#pie(x, label, radious, main,col,clockwise)
#here

# x is a vector that contains the numeric values used in the pie chart
#labels are used to give description to the slices
#radious describes the radious of the pie chart

#main describes the title of the pie chart

#color defines the color pallete

#clockwiise is a logical vakues that indicates the clockwise or 
#anti clockwise direction in which slices are drawn


# creating the data for the graph

colors<- c("green","orange", "purple","white","red","blue")

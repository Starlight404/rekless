#categorial variables
#A catergorial variables or discrete variable is one that has two or more 
#categories(values)
#2 types--Nominal and ordinal
# A nominal value is that has no ordering value(nam matro)
#example --- gender---(male,female)--no ordering values
#ordinal values--it is a value that has a clear ordering---
#like as temparature---(low,medium,high)
# R factor is used to store categorial data as levels. It can
#store both character and integer types of data. Thesr factors are
#created with the help of factor() functions, by taking vector as 
# a input
#factors have labels which are associated with the unique integers stored in it. 
#it contains predefined set value known as levels and by dafault
#R always sort levels in alphabitical orders

#Attributes in R
#X---it is the input vector which is to be transformed into a factor
#levels---it is an input vector that represents a set of unique values are taken
#by x

#labels---it is a chracter vector which corresponds to the number of labels
#exclude---it is used to specify the value which we want to be excluded
#ordered----it is a logical attribute which determines if the levels are ordered
#nmax---it is used to specify the upper bound for the maximun number of level





dir<-c("north","south","east","north")
is.factor(dir)
factor(dir)#---in order
#levels are unique thats why its not repating

factor(dir,levels = c("north","west","east","south"),labels = c("N","W","E","S"))
factor(dir,levels = c("north","west","east","south"),exclude = "north")

#gl()---generate labels ---3 variables-- n,k,labels
#n is the integer given number of lables
#k is the integer giving number of replicants

v1<- gl(3,4, labels = c("tata","honda", "bmw"))# n--number of levels, k--how many copies will it print

#accessing the components of factors
com<- c("bmw", "audi", "ferari")
data<- factor(com)
data[1]

quote<- gl(1,1000, labels = c("money can buy happniess"))
